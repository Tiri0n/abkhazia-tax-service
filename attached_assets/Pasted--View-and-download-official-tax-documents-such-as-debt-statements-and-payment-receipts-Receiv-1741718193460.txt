	Localization and Adaptation Requirements:
		1.	The entire application must be in Russian language by default, including all buttons, labels, error messages, and system notifications.
	2.	The currency displayed should be Russian Rubles (₽), using Russian number formatting (e.g., 1 500,00 ₽ instead of 1,500.00 RUB).
	3.	Dates must follow the DD.MM.YYYY format and support Moscow Standard Time (MSK).
	4.	User authentication should include:
	•	Integration with Gosuslugi (Госуслуги) for secure login.
	•	Alternatively, users can log in using their ИНН (Individual Taxpayer Number) and passport details.
	5.	The app must comply with Russian tax regulations, including handling НДФЛ, УСН, and other common taxation systems for individuals and businesses.
	6.	Integrate Russian payment gateways (e.g., Sberbank Online, Tinkoff Pay, ЮKassa (YooMoney), QIWI) for secure and seamless payments in rubles.
	7.	Provide SMS/email notifications in Russian about tax payment deadlines and account activity.
	8.	Ensure compliance with Federal Law 152-ФЗ on personal data protection and host data on servers within Russia.
	9.	UI/UX design should be intuitive for Russian citizens, simple and mobile-friendly, with options for downloading receipts in PDF format.

	Technology stack suggestions (optional):
		•	Frontend: React (with Russian localization)
	•	Backend: Node.js with Express
	•	Database: PostgreSQL
	•	Authentication: JWT with Gosuslugi/SNILS/ИНН integration
	•	Payment APIs: Sberbank, Tinkoff, YooMoney

	Optional future features (if time allows):
		•	Mobile app version for iOS and Android
	•	Real-time chat with support agents in Russian
	•	Data analytics dashboard for users to track their tax payments over time

	The application must be secure, scalable, and ready for production use within the Russian jurisdiction.
